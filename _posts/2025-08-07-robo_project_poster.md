title: "AgroBot: AI-Powered Precision Weeding for a Sustainable Agricultural Future in Bangladesh"
---

Weed infestation significantly hampers agricultural productivity in Bangladesh, especially for small and marginal farmers. **AgroBot** is a low-cost, autonomous precision weeding robot designed using ROS and AI-based weed detection (YOLOv5) to address this problem.

Key features:
- Vision-guided weeding with YOLOv5 for real-time plant classification.
- Automated navigation using wheel encoder + IMU fused by an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).
- Targeted herbicide spraying mechanism to minimize chemical use.
- Cost-effective deployment using Raspberry Pi and ESP32 (~25,140 BDT total cost).

Our system achieved a **mAP50 score of 0.763** with **<0.2ms** detection latency, and showed a **90% reduction in herbicide usage** during tests.

This work contributes to:
- Supporting small-scale farmers with affordable robotics.
- Reducing labor and environmental impact from traditional weed control.
- Advancing Bangladeshâ€™s national goals in **food security**, **smart agriculture**, and **technological innovation**.
